Code we've written with students of May 18 cohort to see how Express, MongoDB and Mongoose works together along with tests.

To run locally you'll need to `npm i` dependencies and add a `settings.env` file in project root.
`settings.env` file should contain `DATABASE_CONN` variable which is a MongoDB connection string.
